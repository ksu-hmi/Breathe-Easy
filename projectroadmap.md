-[X] Test existing code via Visual Studio Code and attempt to run
-[ ] Consolidate notes for code splices to incorporate into program - Actively ongoing
-[X] Gather symptom and treatment data based on clinical practice guidelines - for use within code
-[ ] Prepare code for "check symptom" menu, questions and output - 18NOV - actively working on, but no fully complete
-[ ] Prepare code for "Login", "Profile", and "Help" screens. Need 2nd review and QA testing - Refining these menus as of 18NOV
-[ ] Verify if program must have application interface (kivy, webflask, etc) or if functioning code in Python is priority
-[X] Prepare program flowchart draft and pdf. Must verify project expectations to potentially reduce scope of program use - Will clarify in 18NOV class. 

Unassigned:
 
[ ] Possibly too much: Can we add timestamp to symptoms added or note input? Or how to add time entry to track with note?
[ ] Review each section of code & as a whole. Pinpoint issues that remain/solve where possible.
