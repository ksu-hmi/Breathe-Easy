-[X] Assign team member roles - oct18
-[X] Find related repositories - oct18
-[X] Application testing via Visual Studio Code and attempt to run - nov5
-[X] Create powerpoint - nov14 - active contributions
-[X] Create code for AAP dropdown application - nov25
-[X] Prepare drop-down code for AAP entry (due to length of medication selection list) - or alternate solution 
-[X] Add/edit asthma medication data excel sheet -nov25
-[X] Make changes to code(s) - nov25 - active contributions
-[X] Identify errors and limitations - dec5 - ongoing tests
-[ ] Review each section of code & as a whole. Pinpoint issues that remain/solve where possible.
-[ ] Record teams video presentation of final code.

Jasmine\
-[X] Join organization
-[X] Find related repositories
-[X] Application testing via Visual Studio Code and attempt to run
-[X] Identify bugs causing the code to crash and resolve them.
-[ ] Add to powerpoint
-[ ] Work out MySQL requirements for DB development and code to connect to functions
-[-] No longer priority task - Make application able to upload to Android 
-[-] No longer priority task - Make applicaiton able to upload to iOs
-[ ] Code to Create a text file per user(parent)/profile(child) entered to track symptom/note inputs

Joli\
-[X] Join organization
-[X] Create application framework
-[x] Add README page with project description to our repository
-[X] Find related repositories or usable code sections
-[X] Test existing code via Visual Studio Code and attempt to run
-[X] Consolidate notes for code splices to incorporate into program - Actively ongoing
-[X] Prepare program flowchart draft and pdf. Must verify project expectations to potentially reduce scope of program use - Will clarify in 18NOV class. 
-[X] Gather symptom and treatment data based on clinical practice guidelines - for use within code
-[X] Prepare code for "check symptom" menu, questions and output - First versions complete, later version to break down individual symptoms to track which they're experiencing by selecting 1-6 in list, etc. 
-[X] Prepare code for "Login", "Profile", and "Help" screens. Need 2nd review and QA testing - Refining these menus
     (Partially complete, Edit AAP, & Note screens/DB connection not realized)
-[x] Flask shell start - ongoing work continues 
-[X] Create video and presentation of final code. Verify if program must have application interface (kivy, webflask, etc) or if functioning code in Python is priority
-[X] Revamp powerpoint presentation and briefing cues

Later stages - unassigned at this time:
 
-[ ] (shifted over to later stage with install and error issues) DB preparation and effective connection via MySQL - need to document/link profile to inputs in AAP entry(meds), symptoms, & notes.
-Can we add timestamp to symptoms added or note input? Or how to add time entry to track with note?
-[ ] Work out how to add timestamp to symptoms added or note input? Or how to add time entry to track with note? - And visually preference to recall info for a provider visit (calendar, vs bulleted list, etc)
-[ ] Make final call on Flask v. Kivy for software interface - Translate the code into the visual model
-[ ] Once interface functional, begin with parent/family member testing to assess usability and recognize critical areas to adjust or prioritize
